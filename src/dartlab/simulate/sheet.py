"""Driver sheet structures + topological deterministic executor (L2.5 born-clean core).

The L2.5 simulate engine builds a driver DAG whose only owned math is the macro→fundamentals
edge transfer (see `simulate/transfer.py`); every other node is a thin call into an L2 leaf.
This module holds the structural foundation per
`mainPlan/scenario-simulator/01-engine-architecture.md` §5/§6:

- `NodeValue` / `DriverNode` / `DriverSheet` — the node contract (§6.1).
- `computeInputsHash` — the memoization-key SSOT (§6.1).
- `buildOrder` — deterministic Kahn topological sort (§6.2).
- `evaluateSheet` — the deterministic executor that resolves deps in topo order and fills each
  node's `det` (§6.2 `_evalDet` analogue).

Determinism by construction: pure functions, no global state, sorted-tie topo order, and an
`inputsHash` over normalized frozen inputs. There is NO lens / AI symbol in this module —
invariant-1 ("deterministic without AI") is proven by the *physical absence* of an AI entry
point, not a runtime branch. The lens path is a later phase.

Naming follows §5: DriverNode / DriverSheet (NOT *Graph / *Loop / *Kernel / *Dag).

Layer: L2.5. Imports nothing above L0 — this file is pure stdlib (no dartlab import).

    Capabilities:
        Returns the evaluation order in which every node appears after all of its deps. Ties
        among ready nodes are broken by sorted nodeId, so the order is stable across runs and
        platforms. A dependency cycle, or a dep on a missing node, raises.

    Args:
        sheet: the DriverSheet whose `nodes` (and their `deps`) define the DAG.

    Returns:
        tuple[str, ...]: nodeIds in a valid, deterministic topological order.

    Raises:

    Guide:
        This is the order `evaluateSheet` walks; calling it directly is useful for previewing or
        validating a sheet before evaluation.

    When:
        Before evaluating, to validate wiring (cycle / missing dep) or to inspect the plan.

    How:
        Build an in-degree map, then run Kahn's algorithm popping the sorted ready set so ties
        resolve deterministically by nodeId.

    SeeAlso:
        - ``evaluateSheet``: consumes this order to resolve and fill each node.
        - ``DriverSheet.add``: builds the node set this sorts.

    Requires:
