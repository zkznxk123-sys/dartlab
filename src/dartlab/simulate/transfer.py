"""The macro→fundamentals edge transfer — the only math the L2.5 driver DAG owns.

Per `mainPlan/scenario-simulator/01-engine-architecture.md` §2/§4, a simulate node is either a
thin call into an L2 leaf or this single owned edge: the linear map from a macro scenario
(GDP / interest rate / FX) onto a company's revenue / margin / WACC, parameterized by a sector
elasticity.

Born-clean: this module imports its constants (`BASELINE_FX`, `BASELINE_RATE`) and the elasticity
type forward from `dartlab.synth.scenario` (L1.5). L2.5 → L1.5 is a legal single-direction import.
It does NOT import from the legacy simulation flow
(`analysis/forecast/simulation.py::_applyMacroShock`, `_simScenario`, `_simMonteCarlo`); that flow
stays untouched. The arithmetic here is a faithful, byte-for-byte port of the legacy transfer.

Layer: L2.5. Forward imports: L1.5 (`synth`).

    """Map one year of macro scalars onto adjusted revenue / margin / WACC (single-year transfer).

    Capabilities:
        The linear macro→fundamentals edge: applies a GDP shock and an FX shock to revenue, a
        GDP shock and (for financials) a rate/NIM shock to margin, and a half-pass-through of the
        rate change to WACC. Byte-identical to the legacy `_applyMacroShock` arithmetic; the only
        signature change is taking the per-year macro scalars directly (the DAG node already holds
        the macro vector) instead of `(scenario, yearIdx)`.

    Args:
        baseRevenue: the prior year's (or base-year's) revenue level, in currency units.
        baseMargin: the prior year's operating margin, in percent.
        gdp: this year's GDP growth, in percent.
        rate: this year's policy/interest rate, in percent.
        fx: this year's FX level (e.g. KRW/USD); shock is measured vs `BASELINE_FX`.
        elasticity: the sector's `SectorElasticity` (revenueToGdp / revenueToFx / marginToGdp /
            nimToRate).
        baseWacc: the base discount rate, in percent.

    Returns:
        tuple[float, float, float]: ``(adjustedRevenue, adjustedMargin, adjustedWacc)``.
        `adjustedMargin` is floored at -50 (legacy ``max(adjustedMargin, -50)``).

    Raises:
        None — pure arithmetic; callers handle absent/invalid inputs upstream.

    Example:
        >>> from dartlab.synth.scenario import SectorElasticity
        >>> e = SectorElasticity(1.8, 0.8, 50, 0, "high")  # 반도체
        >>> rev, mgn, wacc = transferMacroToFundamentals(

    Guide:
        This is a single year. To chain a horizon (each year's adjusted output feeds the next),
        use `transferRevenuePath`, which owns the prevRev/prevMargin carry the legacy
        `simulateScenario` performed.

    When:
        Inside a driver node that holds one year's macro scalars and needs the fundamental impact.

    How:
        Apply GDP and FX shocks to revenue, GDP and (financials) rate shocks to margin, and half
        the rate change to WACC; floor margin at -50.

    SeeAlso:
        - ``transferRevenuePath``: the horizon carry built on this function.
        - ``dartlab.synth.scenario.SectorElasticity``: the elasticity contract.
        - ``dartlab.synth.scenario.getElasticity``: sector-key -> elasticity lookup.

    Requires:
        `BASELINE_FX` / `BASELINE_RATE` from `synth.scenario` (the macro baselines the shock is
        measured against).

    AIContext:
        The output is a deterministic transform of assumptions, not a forecast — always surface
        the elasticity and the macro path used so the assumption is auditable.

    LLM Specifications:
        AntiPatterns:
            - Quoting `adjustedRevenue` as a prediction rather than a scenario transform.
            - Forgetting that FX shock is relative to `BASELINE_FX`, not absolute.
            - Assuming inflation flows through: cpi/inflation has NO transfer channel here. The
              preset (`MacroScenario.cpi`, a 3-year list) carries an inflation path but this edge
              reads only gdp/rate/fx -> revenue/margin/wacc has 0 effect from cpi (nominal-real
              undecomposed). Treat a cpi-sensitive question as out-of-channel, not transmitted.
        OutputSchema: ``tuple[float, float, float]`` = (revenue, margin %, wacc %).
        Prerequisites: numeric base metrics + a `SectorElasticity`.
        Freshness: inherits the freshness of the base metrics and the macro path supplied.
        Dataflow: (gdp, fx vs baseline) -> revenue; (gdp, rate vs baseline) -> margin;
            rate vs baseline -> wacc.

    Capabilities:
        Applies `transferMacroToFundamentals` for each year of the macro paths, feeding each
        year's adjusted revenue and margin in as the next year's base — the prevRev/prevMargin
        carry the legacy `simulateScenario` performed inside its loop (the leaf transfer itself is
        single-year). Produces the revenue / margin / WACC time vectors a `rev.path` driver node

        baseRevenue: the base-year revenue level (year 0's input base).

        3

    Guide:
        The carry is what makes a recession compound: year 1's depressed revenue is the base year
        2 grows/shrinks from. A `proforma` node downstream converts this absolute revenue path
        into a year-over-year growth path before calling the L2 leaf (that conversion is edge
        wiring, owned by the node, not leaf math).

    When:
        Inside a `rev.path` driver node that holds the full macro horizon for one scenario.

    How:
        Loop the years, calling `transferMacroToFundamentals`, then carry (prevRev, prevMargin) =
        (adjRev, adjMargin) so each shock persists into the next year.

    SeeAlso:
        - ``transferMacroToFundamentals``: the single-year transfer this chains.
        - ``dartlab.analysis.financial.proforma.buildProforma``: the L2 leaf that consumes the
          growth path derived from this output.

    Requires:
        The three macro paths and a `SectorElasticity` (see `transferMacroToFundamentals`).

    AIContext:
        Report the full path, not just the last year — the trajectory (drawdown then recovery) is
        the point of a scenario, and the carry makes early-year shocks persist.

    LLM Specifications:
        AntiPatterns:
            - Quoting only the terminal revenue and losing the carry-driven trajectory.
            - Assuming WACC compounds — only revenue and margin carry; WACC is re-derived per year
              from the rate change vs baseline.
        OutputSchema: ``tuple[list[float], list[float], list[float]]`` (revenue, margin %, wacc %).
